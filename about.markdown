# HUMAN 2DH3 (Winter 2024)
## Creative, Collaborative, Critical: Approaches to Digital Scholarship

**HUMAN 2DH3** provides a comprehensive overview of topics in digital scholarship through project-based learning, including project management, digitization, curation, information visualization, digital storytelling, and the social and ethical implications of digital domains of knowledge. Students will develop a framework from which to create and understand digital scholarship across a range of disciplines.

*"All models are wrong, but some are useful." - George Box*

This iteration of HUMAN 2DH3 uses data models, the re/presentation and communication of data through visuals and/or sound, as an invitation to rethink our assumptions of data and explore new approaches to digital design that embrace subjectivity and uncertainty. The practicum component will feature a weekly data “show and tell,” in which students choose an open-source data model — a graph, map, or sonification — and analyze the design decisions, with reference to that weeks’ critical data and/or design theory reading. For the final project, students will creatively “re-make” their chosen dataset, transforming and remodeling the data using the techniques and methods studied in class (e.g. graphic scores, counter-mapping). The hands-on approach requires students to actively engage with and reflect on the role of human agents and decision-making (selections/exclusions, biases, and empathy/affect) in the expression and communication of data findings.
