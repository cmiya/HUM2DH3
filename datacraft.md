# Data Craft: HUM2DH3 Student Design Showcase 
### April 12 - May 12 <br> Sherman Centre Lobby, 1st Floor Mills Library

From khipu beads to sundials, there is a long history and tradition of hand-crafted data models (Gwilt 2022; Huron et al. 2023; Offenhuber 2023).

The challenge for the HUM2DH3: Digital Scholarship class was to use creative materials and methods to re-design and transform a rudimentary chart or graph into a physical, crafted object or sonification piece. The student projects in the exhibit invite us to reflect on how to engage with data in thoughtful, intentional ways and experiment with new modes of storytelling through design.
